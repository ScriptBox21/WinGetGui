# WinGetGui
A very basic app that provides a GUI for installing apps through WinGet.

It's implemented in WPF using [ModernWpf](https://github.com/Kinnara/ModernWpf) for UI styling and some controls.

Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/goranalkovic/WinGetGui/releases) to download.

For transparency source code is in the repo, free for anybody to look at (might be a mess a times ðŸ˜„).
